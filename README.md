# Password-Generator

1. Generating a Password: 
The user answers with "Yes" or "No" to questions about using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols.
The user then enters the desired length of the password.
A password alphabet is generated based on the user's answers, which is a string containing the chosen characters.
Random characters from the password alphabet are selected and combined to form a completely random string according to the user's preferences.
The randomly generated password is then displayed on the console.


3. Checking a Password strength:
The strength check is based on the following criteria:

The password uses uppercase letters.
The password uses lowercase letters.
The password uses numbers.
The password uses symbols.
The length of the password is 8 or more (8 is often the minimum required length for a decent password).
The length of the password is 16 or more (16 is considered to be the minimum length for a good password).
